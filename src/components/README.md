# Shared Components Documentation

This directory contains reusable UI components for the Lock Focus platform. The design system emphasizes high-contrast, accessibility-conscious aesthetics.

## Design Principles
- **Aesthetic**: Modern, neon-accented dark mode with blur-heavy backdrop effects.
- **Accessibility**: High-contrast ratios (WCAG compliant where possible) and clear, large interactive targets.
- **Interactivity**: Primarily driven by `framer-motion` to provide smooth, low-cognitive-load transitions.

## Key Components
- **DashboardLayout**: Provides the consistent shell for all sub-tools, including the persistent attention state header.
- **Common Elements**: Found in various sub-directories, these include specialized cards and buttons designed for users with ADHD and vision stress.

# Lock Focus

Lock Focus is an immersive web application designed to help users assess, track, and improve their cognitive focus. Built with modern web technologies, it combines productivity tools with a visually engaging interface to create a unique user experience.

## � Problem Statement

- **Static Content Design**: Most interfaces use fixed layouts. They assume linear reading. This causes cognitive overload.
- **Poor Neurodiversity Support**: Dense text blocks hurt readability. ADHD and dyslexic users struggle. No adaptive reading flow.
- **No Real-Time User Awareness**: Systems don’t track attention signals. No detection of skimming or confusion. Feedback comes too late or never.
- **Accessibility Needs Manual Setup**: Tools depend on diagnosis or settings. Many users never enable them. Support doesn’t reach scale.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

**An Intent-Aware, Adaptive Reading Ecosystem**

- **Dynamic Personalisation**: Platform that reshapes content in real time based on how a user interacts with the screen.
- **Behavioural Intelligence**: Actively adjusts layout, text emphasis, and pacing using engagement signals.
